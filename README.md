# üè†AirBnb Project

The AirBnb Project is a replica of the real AirBnb site, created to test and enhance my JavaScript skills by adding features and interactability similar to the actual product.

Some of the features I implemented include:

+ **Search Bar**: Users can search for vacation rentals based on location.
+ **Price Range Slider**: Users can adjust a slider to filter vacation rentals by price range, displaying only the options within the selected range.
+ **Category Selection**: Users can filter what type of vacation rentals will be displayed by choosing between three types: Entire Place, Private Room, or Shared Room.
